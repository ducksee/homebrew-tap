# Brew formula for duckterm-hookd. Source of truth lives at
# tools/duckterm-hookd/Formula/duckterm-hookd.rb in the (private) DuckTerm
# repo; a copy is published to ducksee/homebrew-tap. Release assets are
# static binaries published to the public ducksee/duckterm-hookd-releases
# repo (the main repo is private — brew can't fetch private release assets).
#
# Release flow: ./build-all.sh → pack tarballs (+LICENSE) → gh release create
# on ducksee/duckterm-hookd-releases → update sha256s here → push to tap.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      duckterm-hookd is a daemon. After install:

        duckterm-hookd pair --token <pairing-token>   # from the DuckTerm app
        duckterm-hookd install                        # wire agent hooks
        brew services start duckterm-hookd

      Starting the service before pairing is safe — it waits and retries
      with backoff until you pair.

      The `install` step is non-destructive — it appends entries to
      ~/.claude/settings.json and ~/.codex/hooks.json without removing
      existing hooks. `duckterm-hookd uninstall` filters out only its own
      entries.
