# Brew formula for duckterm-hookd. Source of truth lives at
# tools/duckterm-hookd/Formula/duckterm-hookd.rb in the (private) DuckTerm
# repo; a copy is published to ducksee/homebrew-tap. Release assets are
# static binaries published to the public ducksee/duckterm-hookd-releases
# repo (the main repo is private — brew can't fetch private release assets).
#
# Release flow: ./build-all.sh → pack tarballs (+LICENSE) → gh release create
# on ducksee/duckterm-hookd-releases → update sha256s here → push to tap.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      duckterm-hookd is a daemon. After install:

        duckterm-hookd pair --qr                      # scan in the DuckTerm app (easiest)
        # or:  duckterm-hookd pair --token <token>    # DuckTerm app → Settings → Agent Hooks
        duckterm-hookd install                        # wire agent hooks
        brew services start duckterm-hookd

      Check version, pairing, and installed-hook state anytime:
        duckterm-hookd status

      Starting the service before pairing is safe — it waits and retries
      with backoff until you pair.

      The `install` step is non-destructive — it appends entries to
      ~/.claude/settings.json and ~/.codex/hooks.json without removing
      existing hooks. `duckterm-hookd uninstall` filters out only its own
      entries.

      Upgrade (one command — refreshes the tap Homebrew won't auto-pull,
      upgrades, and restarts the service):
        duckterm-hookd upgrade

      Uninstall (removes only DuckTerm's own hook entries, then the binary):
        duckterm-hookd uninstall && brew services stop duckterm-hookd && brew uninstall duckterm-hookd
